This repository contains the source for the blog of [Matt Olson](http://mattolson.com). I've posted it here
mainly as an example of how to use the excellent [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) framework for static
site generation, as well as an example of how to extend my own [middleman-zurb-template](https://github.com/mattolson/middleman-zurb-template).

Feel free to check it out, but please don't copy my site design directly, it would be in very poor taste
to do so.
