## Matt Olson

I&rsquo;m a [systems thinker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking), [hacker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(programmer_subculture%29), and
[social entrepreneur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_entrepreneurship) living in beautiful [Chico, CA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chico,_California).

I&rsquo;m a software engineer by profession, and while I&rsquo;m excited by new technology and elegant hacks of all kinds, of particular interest to me is
applying [social business](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_business) to seemingly intractable problems, such as global warming, wealth inequality, 
the clash between unsustainable growth and environmental stewardship, the deterioration of community and increased social alienation. These are outcomes
of systemic design flaws&mdash;a system of our own creation that can be changed.

I seek to help build, as [Buckminster Fuller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller) put it:

> a world that works for 100% of humanity,
> in the shortest possible time,
> through spontaneous cooperation,
> without ecological offense,
> or the disadvantage of anyone.

I believe in the capacity of human creativity and collective action to change the course of history. We live in a unique age when individuals and
small groups can build and deliver new tools to a significant percentage of the world easily and inexpensively, spread ideas and coordinate action 
as never before.
