What are we, children?

All these game mechanics built into the latest crop of location based services are dreamt up by a few people sitting around trying to figure out how 
to manipulate us into giving them a constant data stream on our daily activities.

From a user perspective, I resent the condescension inherent in the approach. And from a business perspective, I don&rsquo;t believe they are building 
anything of real value, unless it&rsquo;s their intention to sell their users out to the highest bidder (which of course it is).

Who will get that data, Facebook or Google? My bet&rsquo;s on Google.
